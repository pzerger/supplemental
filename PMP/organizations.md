### Balanced Matrix

A balanced matrix organization is a type of matrix structure where project managers and functional managers share equal authority and responsibility for project resources. In this setup, team members report to both their functional manager and the project manager.

**Advantages**: Balanced matrix structures provide a good compromise between functional and project-oriented organizations, allowing for efficient resource allocation and cross-functional collaboration.

### Composite Organization

A composite organization combines elements of various organizational structures (functional, matrix, and projectized) to create a hybrid model that best suits the company's needs. This structure allows for flexibility in how different projects or departments are managed within the same organization.

**Advantages**: Composite organizations offer the advantage of tailoring the organizational structure to specific project needs, potentially improving efficiency and effectiveness across diverse project types.

### Matrix Organization

A matrix organization is a structure that creates dual lines of authority and combines functional and project organizations. Employees in a matrix organization report to both a functional manager and a project manager.

**Advantages**: Matrix organizations facilitate efficient use of resources, promote cross-functional collaboration, and allow for a balance between project and functional priorities.

### Projectized Organization

In a projectized organization, team members are grouped by project rather than function. Project managers have full authority over resources and team members report directly to the project manager. Functional managers have little to no authority in this structure.

**Advantages**: Projectized organizations provide strong focus on project objectives, clear lines of authority, and improved communication within project teams.

### Strong Matrix

A strong matrix is a type of matrix organization where project managers have more authority and responsibility than functional managers. While team members still report to both, the project manager has primary control over resources and decision-making.

**Advantages**: Strong matrix structures emphasize project priorities while maintaining some functional expertise, allowing for efficient project execution and resource utilization.

### Weak Matrix

A weak matrix is a type of matrix organization where functional managers have more authority than project managers. Project managers have limited authority and act more as coordinators or expeditors than direct managers of the project.

**Advantages**: Weak matrix structures maintain strong functional expertise while allowing for some project coordination, which can be beneficial in organizations where functional specialization is crucial.
