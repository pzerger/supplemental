## 01. Stewardship
Stewardship involves taking responsibility for the efficient and effective use of project resources. Project managers should act as responsible stewards, ensuring that resources are used wisely and ethically to create value for the organization and its stakeholders.

## 02. Team
The Team principle emphasizes the importance of creating a collaborative and supportive team environment. Project managers should invest in team development, foster open communication, and promote a shared sense of purpose and accountability among team members.

## 03. Stakeholders
The Stakeholders principle highlights the need to engage and manage stakeholders proactively throughout the project lifecycle. Project managers should identify stakeholders, understand their interests and expectations, and develop strategies to communicate and collaborate with them effectively.

## 04. Value
The Value principle focuses on delivering value to the organization and its stakeholders. Project managers should ensure that project objectives align with organizational strategy and stakeholder needs, and continuously seek opportunities to optimize value creation.

## 05. Systems Thinking
Systems Thinking involves understanding how projects fit within the larger organizational context and how they impact and are impacted by external factors. Project managers should adopt a holistic view of projects and consider the interdependencies and interactions among project components, stakeholders, and the environment.

The Quality principle focuses on delivering project results that meet or exceed stakeholder expectations and requirements. Project managers should establish quality standards, implement quality assurance and control processes, and continuously monitor and improve project quality.

## 09. Complexity

## 10. Risk
The Risk principle emphasizes the need to identify, assess, and manage project risks proactively. Project managers should develop risk management plans, implement risk response strategies, and continuously monitor and control risks throughout the project lifecycle.

## 11. Adaptability and Resilience
Adaptability and Resilience involve the ability to respond effectively to change and recover quickly from setbacks. Project managers should cultivate a flexible and resilient mindset, anticipate and plan for change, and develop strategies to adapt and bounce back from challenges and disruptions.

The Change principle recognizes that change is inevitable in projects and should be managed proactively. Project managers should establish change management processes, assess the impact of changes on project objectives and stakeholders, and communicate and implement changes effectively.
