## Risk Frameworks
Risk frameworks provide a structured approach to identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and managing risk to guide decision-making. They provide the overarching structure for making risk-informed decisions. 

### NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF):

**Purpose**: Provides a structured process for identifying, assessing, responding to, and monitoring risks within the context of information systems. It's a comprehensive lifecycle approach to risk management.

**Oversight/Enforcement**: Widely used by the US government. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) develops and maintains the framework, while individual agencies are responsible for implementation and enforcement within their systems.

### ISO 31000: Risk Management:

**Purpose**: An international standard providing principles and guidelines for managing risks faced by organizations of any type or industry. It's a broad risk management framework not specifically tailored to cybersecurity.

**Oversight/Enforcement**: Developed and maintained by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). There's no single enforcement body; organizations voluntarily adopt this and may be subject to audits or certifications.

## Security Control Frameworks

Security control frameworks provide a prescriptive set of cybersecurity safeguards and best practices to protect an organizationâ€™s valuable assets. They help in implementing the risk management strategy. 

### CIS Controls:

**Purpose**: A prioritized set of cybersecurity best practices and actions developed to safeguard against common cyberattacks.

**Oversight/Enforcement**: Developed and maintained by the Center for Internet Security (CIS), a non-profit organization. No central enforcement, but CIS Controls are widely referenced as industry benchmarks.

### COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies):

**Purpose**: A framework developed by ISACA for IT governance and management. COBIT includes a security focus, providing guidance on aligning security objectives with business goals.

**Oversight/Enforcement**: ISACA develops and maintains COBIT. It's a framework for best practices, not typically directly enforced.

### FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program):

**Purpose**: A U.S. government program that standardizes security assessments and authorizations for cloud services used by federal agencies.

**Oversight/Enforcement**: Managed by a Joint Authorization Board (JAB) and the FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO) within the GSA. Individual agencies are responsible for selecting FedRAMP-authorized services and ongoing monitoring.

### FISMA (Federal Information Security Modernization Act):

**Purpose**: U.S. law that mandates the implementation of security programs for federal agencies and their contractors handling federal information.

**Oversight/Enforcement**: NIST sets standards and guidelines for compliance. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and agency Inspectors General oversee implementation and enforcement.

### HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act):

**Purpose**: U.S. legislation that sets standards for protecting sensitive patient health information (PHI). It includes security rules and privacy rules that covered entities must follow.

**Oversight/Enforcement**: The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is responsible for enforcing HIPAA.

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF):

**Purpose**: A flexible, risk-based framework that provides guidance on how to protect critical infrastructure and assets from cyber threats. Its core functions are Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.

**Oversight/Enforcement**: Developed and maintained by NIST. Not mandatory for most private companies, but its adoption is growing across industries. Some regulated sectors may reference or require aligning with the CSF.

### ISO/IEC 27001/27002

**Purpose**: International standards for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS). ISO 27001 outlines the requirements for establishing an ISMS, while ISO 27002 provides best practice security controls that an organization can choose to implement.

**Oversight/Enforcement**: Developed and maintained by ISO and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Organizations can seek ISO 27001 certification, involving audits by third-party certification bodies.

### PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard):

**Purpose**: A set of strict security requirements designed to protect cardholder data and prevent credit card fraud. Applies to any organization that stores, processes, or transmits payment card information.

**Oversight/Enforcement**: Developed and managed by the PCI Security Standards Council (an independent body founded by major card brands). Compliance is enforced through contractual agreements and audits.

### SABSA (Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture):

**Purpose**: A methodology and framework for developing and implementing risk-driven security architectures aligned with business objectives. It emphasizes a layered approach and integration with other frameworks.

**Oversight/Enforcement**: Developed and maintained by the SABSA Institute, a non-profit organization. There's no central enforcement; organizations adopt SABSA for enhanced security architecture design.

### SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act):

**Purpose**: U.S. law focused on improving financial reporting and corporate governance of publicly traded companies. SOX has implications for IT security controls that protect the integrity of financial data.

**Oversight/Enforcement**: The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversees SOX compliance, and companies must undergo external audits.
