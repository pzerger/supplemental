## Categories of Security Controls

### Administrative Security Controls

Administrative security controls are management policies, procedures, and guidelines that specify how an organization manages personnel security issues and implements security policies. They are focused on the human side of security.

Examples include:

- **Security policies** - High-level statements of direction and intention used to guide decisions. Help formally express management's view.
- **Procedures** - Define what steps are required to implement policies. Help put policies into action. 
- **Standards** - Mandatory requirements that provide specific details to meet the intent of a policy.
- **Guidelines** - Recommended actions and operational guides to employees to effectively implement procedures.

### Logical/Technical Security Controls

Logical or technical security controls use technology solutions to control access and monitor systems. They focus on logical access control, encryption, malware defense, network security, and other technical protections.

Examples include: 

- **Firewalls** - Hardware or software devices that filter traffic between networks based on rules.
- **Intrusion detection systems (IDS)** - Software that monitors networks/systems for malicious activity and alerts administrators. 
- **Encryption** - Encoding data to protect confidentiality and integrity.
- **Access control lists (ACLs)** - Policies that control access to network resources.

### Physical Security Controls

Physical security controls are safeguards to protect facility access, resources, and information systems through locked doors, guards, fences, etc. They focus on physical barriers and access control.

- **Badge access systems** - ID badges with embedded smart chips, RFID, etc. to control physical access. 
- **Mantraps** - Small single-person areas between two locked doors to control entry.
- **Security guards** - Personnel used to monitor premises and respond to incidents.
- **Fences** - Physical barriers around facility perimeter to limit access.
