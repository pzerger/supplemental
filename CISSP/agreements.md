## Enterprise License Agreement (ELA)

An **Enterprise License Agreement (ELA)** is a contract between a software vendor and an enterprise customer that allows the customer to license software or services on a large scale across the entire organization. ELAs provide volume discounts in exchange for a commitment to use that vendor's products exclusively or at a minimum percentage for a set period of time, typically 3-5 years.

ELAs are commonly used by large organizations to simplify license management, budgeting, and negotiations with major software vendors.

## Mutual assistance agreement (MAA)

A **mutual assistance agreement (MAA)** is an agreement between two or more organizations, often in the same industry or region, to provide assistance to each other in the event of an emergency or business disruption. This may include sharing physical resources, technical skills and support, cybersecurity assistance, or other capabilities needed to continue critical business functions.

MAAs help improve resilience and incident response, so they are commonly used for business continuity planning and organizational security. Industries like energy, finance, and healthcare frequently use MAAs to agree on aid in scenarios like power outages, cyber attacks, or other crises that could impact operations.

## Memorandum Of Agreement (MOA) 

A **Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)** is a written document outlining the terms and details of an agreement between two or more parties. MOAs are often used between government agencies or other public sector organizations to establish partnerships, set expectations, assign responsibilities, or pledge contribution of resources to collaborative efforts and services.

While an MOA indicates an intended common purpose or shared vision between parties, the specifics are usually not legally binding like a contract. MOAs help coordinate efforts and streamline communication about reciprocal commitments between organizations working towards similar goals.

## Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU)

A **Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)** is a written agreement outlining the terms and details between multiple parties to cooperatively work together towards common goals and objectives. 

MOUs help facilitate communication, coordination, resource sharing, and execution of collaborative activities between organizations in either the public or private sector. They demonstrate mutual intent to formalize a relationship, but do not legally bind parties to adherence like a contract.

MOUs are commonly used for public-private partnerships, research collaborations, sharing resources or personnel, joint policy initiatives, and other relationships with flexible or evolving objectives.

## Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) 

A **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)** is a legal contract that establishes confidentiality between two or more parties, protecting sensitive information they may share or access about each otherâ€™s organizations as part of a business relationship or transaction.  

NDAs prohibit disclosure of specified proprietary, sensitive, or confidential data beyond those party to the agreement for a defined period of time unless compelled by law. They provide legal protections around privacy, trade secrets, and intellectual property.

NDAs are commonly a prerequisite in business negotiations, vendor contracts, private partnerships, security assessments, mergers and acquisitions, employment agreements, and other sharing of non-public information between organizations.

## Operational Level Agreement (OLA)

An **Operational Level Agreement (OLA)** defines the working relationship between internal teams, units, or organizations to deliver a service. OLAs specify the expected service, schedule, frequency, quality, responsibilities, escalation procedures, and other dynamics of operations between service providers and business units.

OLAs help align information technology infrastructure and support teams to the business needs of individual departments, projects, or products they enable within an organization. They are commonly used for clarifying expectations around internal support services like network operations, help desk, or application management.

## Service Level Agreement (SLA)

A **Service Level Agreement (SLA)** is a contract between a service provider, either internal or external, and the end user that defines the level of service expected from the provider. SLAs detail the services to be provided, metrics for measuring them, accountability for delivery, and remedies or penalties if agreed standards are not met.

SLAs allow both parties to agree on service expectations for critical business functions like uptime percentages, response times, security policies, or support response commitments essential to customers and end users. They are vital for managing outsourced IT services, cloud migrations, and vendor management.
