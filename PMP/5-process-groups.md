# 5 PMI Process Groups

We have the five process groups from the Project Management Institute where we're initiating, planning our project, executing our project, monitoring and controlling our project, and closing our project as we go along. 

The process groups are sequential but can overlap. Planning happens through the life of the project. Executing and monitoring/controlling occur in parallel through most phases of the project.

The five process groups in project management according to PMI:

## 1. Initiating

This involves authorizing and defining the project or phase. Key activities include developing the project charter, identifying stakeholders, and establishing the project team.

## 2. Planning 

This involves creating the project management plan and defining the scope, time, cost, quality, resources, communications, risks, procurements, and other aspects of the project. Key tools used include the scope statement, WBS, schedule, budget, and project management plan.

## 3. Executing

This puts the project plan into action. The project team performs the work, manages resources, creates deliverables, provides status reporting, and requests changes as needed.

## 4. Monitoring and Controlling

This oversees project work to meet objectives. Activities involve tracking progress, monitoring risks, managing changes, and taking corrective actions as needed. Earned value management is a key tool.

## 5. Closing

This formalizes project or phase completion. Activities include finalizing documentation, releasing resources, closing contracts, obtaining customer acceptance, and conducting lessons learned.
