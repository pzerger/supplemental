## 01. Stakeholders
The Stakeholders performance domain encompasses all the activities required to maintain productive stakeholder relationships. It includes identifying stakeholders, analyzing their interests and expectations, and engaging them in project decisions and activities. The domain emphasizes the importance of continuous communication and collaboration with both internal and external stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle.

## 02. Team
The Team performance domain focuses on activities related to establishing and maintaining a high-performing project team. It includes defining team roles and responsibilities, developing team skills and competencies, and promoting a collaborative team culture. The domain also emphasizes the importance of leadership, motivation, and conflict resolution in achieving project objectives.

## 03. Development Approach and Life Cycle
The Development Approach and Life Cycle performance domain covers activities related to defining, selecting, and applying a project development approach and life cycle. It includes determining the most appropriate development approach (predictive, iterative, agile, or hybrid) based on project characteristics and goals. The domain also involves aligning the selected approach with organizational processes, practices, and methodologies.

## 04. Planning
The Planning performance domain encompasses activities related to establishing and maintaining a project plan. It includes defining project scope, creating a work breakdown structure, developing a project schedule, and estimating project costs. The domain also involves establishing project baselines, defining project metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs), and developing a project communication plan.

## 05. Project Work
The Project Work performance domain covers activities related to leading and managing project execution. It includes acquiring and managing project resources, directing and managing project work, and implementing project changes. The domain also involves monitoring project progress, managing project issues and risks, and ensuring project deliverables meet quality standards.

## 06. Delivery
The Delivery performance domain focuses on activities related to delivering project results and transferring the project to operations. It includes verifying project deliverables, obtaining stakeholder acceptance, and transitioning the project to the organization. The domain also involves conducting post-project reviews, documenting lessons learned, and celebrating project successes.

## 07. Measurement
The Measurement performance domain encompasses activities related to assessing project performance and health. It includes collecting project data, analyzing project metrics and KPIs, and reporting project status to stakeholders. The domain also involves using project data to identify trends, forecast future performance, and make data-driven decisions.

## 08. Uncertainty
The Uncertainty performance domain covers activities related to identifying and managing project uncertainty and risk. It includes identifying potential project risks, assessing their likelihood and impact, and developing risk response plans. The domain also involves monitoring project risks throughout the project lifecycle and adapting risk management strategies as needed. Additionally, it includes managing project issues and changes and ensuring project resilience in the face of uncertainty.
