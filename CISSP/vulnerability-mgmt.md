# Vulnerability Management

Vulnerability management is the systematic process of identifying, evaluating, treating, and reporting on security vulnerabilities in systems and the software that runs on them.

- **Vulnerability Analysis**: The process of defining, identifying, and classifying the security holes in information systems.
  
- **Assessments**: Evaluations of a system or application to identify the presence of vulnerabilities. This typically includes a combination of manual and automated techniques.

- **Management**: The oversight and control of the vulnerability management process, including prioritization and remediation strategies.

- **Scanners**: Tools that automatically search systems for known vulnerabilities. Common examples include Nessus and OpenVAS.

- **Scans**: The actual processes of using vulnerability scanners to detect weaknesses in systems.
