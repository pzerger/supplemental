# Asset Management 

Asset management pertains to the governance and procedures for managing an organization's assets, including information assets.

- **Identification**: Recognizing and distinguishing assets based on unique characteristics. Knowing what assets an organization has is essential for securing them appropriately. 

- **Inventory**: Maintaining a list or database of assets, often with details about each asset. A comprehensive inventory enables tailored security controls for each asset.

- **Classification**: Assigning a level of sensitivity and criticality to assets, often for the purpose of determining security controls. Proper classification facilitates risk-based security programs.

- **Valuation**: Assigning a monetary or strategic value to assets, which can aid in risk management decisions. Understanding asset value guides cost-effective safeguards. 

- **Ownership**: Determining and documenting the individual or group responsible for an asset. Defined ownership assigns accountability for security.

- **Lifecycle**: The process by which managers purchase, use, monitor, maintain, and replace or dispose of an asset. Includes multiple steps from procurement, use, supervision, and upkeep, to eventual replacement or disposal.

- **Disposition**: The process of disposing of assets, which might include deletion, destruction, transfer, or archival. Controlled disposition prevents unauthorized access to old assets.
