### Fit for purpose
"Fit for purpose" refers to how well a product or feature fulfills its intended function or meets the needs of its users.

Importance: This concept helps teams focus on delivering value and meeting user needs rather than gold-plating or over-engineering solutions.

### Fit for use
"Fit for use" refers to how well a product or feature can be used for its intended purpose in its intended environment.

Importance: This concept encourages teams to consider factors like usability, performance, and reliability in addition to mere functionality.

### Framework
In Agile, a framework is a particular set of practices, roles, events, and artifacts used to implement Agile development.

Importance: Frameworks provide structure and guidance for implementing Agile principles, helping teams and organizations adopt Agile practices more effectively.

### Anti-pattern
In Agile, an anti-pattern is a common response to a recurring problem that is usually ineffective and risks being highly counterproductive. It's essentially a "pattern" that you should avoid.

Importance: Recognizing and avoiding anti-patterns helps teams prevent common pitfalls in Agile implementation. This awareness can save time, improve efficiency, and maintain the integrity of Agile practices.

### Blocker
A blocker is an issue or problem that prevents a team or individual from progressing on a task or project.

Importance: Identifying and addressing blockers quickly is crucial in Agile projects to maintain team momentum and productivity. Regular stand-up meetings often include discussions of blockers to ensure they're resolved promptly.

### Broken comb
The broken comb is a visual representation of a sprint where some tasks extend beyond the sprint timebox, resembling the shape of a broken comb.

Importance: Recognizing a broken comb pattern can help teams identify issues with sprint planning, task estimation, or scope creep, leading to improvements in future sprints.

### Cross-functional team
A cross-functional team is composed of members with different functional expertise working toward a common goal.

Importance: Cross-functional teams are central to Agile methodologies. They enable faster decision-making, promote knowledge sharing, and allow the team to deliver complete features without external dependencies.

### Definition of done
The Definition of Done (DoD) is a clear and concise list of requirements that a product increment must adhere to for the team to call it complete.

Importance: A well-defined DoD ensures quality, reduces rework, and creates a shared understanding of what it means for work to be complete.

### Definition of ready
The Definition of Ready describes the criteria that a user story must meet before being accepted into an upcoming iteration or sprint.

Importance: This helps ensure that items brought into a sprint are clear, understood, and actionable, reducing delays and misunderstandings during the sprint.

### Hybrid approach
A hybrid approach combines elements of Agile with traditional project management methodologies.

Importance: Hybrid approaches can be useful for organizations transitioning to Agile or operating in environments where pure Agile is not feasible.

### Incremental life cycle
An incremental life cycle is an approach where the product is designed, implemented, and tested incrementally until it is finished.

Importance: This approach allows for early delivery of partial but working functionality, enabling early feedback and value delivery.

### Iterative life cycle
An iterative life cycle is an approach where the product evolves through repeated cycles (iterations) of development.

Importance: Iterative development allows for continuous refinement based on feedback, supporting the Agile principle of responding to change.

### Organizational bias
Organizational bias refers to systematic errors in decision-making that occur due to organizational structures, processes, or culture.

Importance: Recognizing and addressing organizational biases is crucial for successful Agile adoption and continuous improvement.

### Predictive life cycle
A predictive life cycle is a more traditional approach where the project scope, time, and cost are determined in the early phases of the project.

Importance: Understanding predictive lifecycles helps Agile practitioners appreciate the differences and potential challenges when transitioning from traditional to Agile methods.

### Project Management Office (PMO)
A PMO is a group or department within an organization that defines and maintains standards for project management.

Importance: In Agile organizations, PMOs often need to adapt their role to support Agile ways of working while still providing necessary governance and support.

### Servant Leadership
Servant leadership is a leadership philosophy where the leader's main goal is to serve their team, rather than to control or direct.

Importance: This leadership style aligns well with Agile principles and is often emphasized for roles like Scrum Master.

### Siloed organization
A siloed organization is one where different departments or groups do not share information or collaborate effectively with each other.

Importance: Recognizing and breaking down silos is often crucial for successful Agile adoption and effective cross-functional collaboration.

This completes the full list of Agile project management terms, grouped into meaningful categories with their explanations and importance.
