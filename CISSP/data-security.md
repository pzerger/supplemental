Here are descriptions of the data protection topics:

## Data/Information Lifecycle

- **Create/Creation**: The process of generating new data or information.

- **Classification**: Categorizing data based on its sensitivity and importance to determine security controls. Data should be classified as soon as possible after creation to facilitate data protection.

- **Store/Storage**: Saving and retaining data in a repository like a database or file server. Data should be encrypted at rest.

- **Use/Usage**: Accessing and utilizing data for its intended business purpose. Data should be encrypted in-transit.

- **Share/Sharing**: Disseminating or providing access to data to authorized users. Data protection should travel with the data, even outside the organization.

- **Archival/Retention**: Storing data long-term for legal, compliance or historical purposes. 

- **Destruction**: Permanently deleting data when no longer needed. Data should be destroyed as quickly as allowable, as additional data = additional risk.

## Data Destruction

- **Clearing (overwriting)**: Overwriting data making it recoverable with forensics. Leaves data remnants. Allows forensic recovery. Low security.

- **Cryptographic erasure**: Encrypting data then destroying the keys. Leaves encrypted data remnants. Prevents forensic recovery if keys are destroyed. Medium security.

- **Degaussing**: Removing magnetic field erasing data on tapes/disks. Leaves no data remnants. Prevents forensic recovery. High security. 

- **Destruction**: Physical destruction of media. Leaves no data remnants if destroyed completely. Prevents forensic recovery if fully destroyed. High security.

- **Erasing**: Deleting pointers to data. Leaves data remnants. Allows forensic recovery. Low security.

- **Purging**: Removing data completely. Leaves no data remnants. Prevents forensic recovery. High security.

## Data Protection

- **Anonymization**: Removing personally identifiable information from data.

- **Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)**: Managing access and enforcing security policies for cloud services.

- **Data classification**: Categorizing data by sensitivity for access control.

- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: Preventing unauthorized release of sensitive data.

- **Data marking/labeling**: Visually tagging data for handling instructions.

- **Data handling**: Processes for using and protecting data.

- **Pseudonymization**: Replacing identifying data with artificial identifiers.

- **Record retention**: Maintaining records for a defined period.

- **Tape Backup Security**: Protecting tape backups from theft/damage.

## Data Roles

- **Asset Owners**: Responsible for an organization's assets.

- **Business/Mission Owners**: Own business processes using the data.

- **Data Administrators**: Manage databases and data storage systems.  

- **Data breach notification**: Required disclosure of breaches.

- **Data Controller (GDPR)**: Determines data processing purposes and means.

- **Data custodian**: Protects and uses data according to policy.

- **Data destruction**: Permanently deleting data when no longer needed.

- **Data handling**: Using and protecting data appropriately.

- **Data owner/controller (GDPR)**: Determines purposes and means of processing data.

- **Data Processor (GDPR)**: Processes personal data on controller's behalf.

- **Data subject (GDPR)**: Person identified by their personal data.

- **Data Transfer (GDPR)**: Moving personal data cross-border.

- **Data User**: Access and uses data appropriately.
