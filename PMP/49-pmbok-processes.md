The PMBOK 49 processes for project management are broken down into five PMBOK process groups, which represent the phases a project goes through, from its initiation to its closure.

## 5 PMI Process Groups

1. Initiating
2. Planning
3. Executing
4. Monitoring and Controlling
5. Closing

## 10 Knowledge Areas of Project Management

There are 10 knowledge areas which applied throughout the 5 process groups. Each knowledge area represents a complete area of specialization including jargon, tools, concepts and tasks. You will need to know something about each of them in order to be able to successfully manage a project. And to achieve your PMP® credential you’ll have to answer questions on each of them.

The 49 processes are described in order here.

1. [Project Integration Management](#integration-management)
2. [Project Scope Management](#scope-management)
3. [Project Schedule Management](#schedule-management)
4. [Project Cost Management](#cost-management)
5. [Project Quality Management](#quality-management)
6. [Project Resource Management](#resource-management)
7. [Project Communications Management](#communications-management)
8. [Project Risk Management](#risk-management)
9. [Project Procurement Management](#procurement-management)
10. [Project Stakeholder Management](#stakeholder-management)

Knowledge Areas are made up of processes, which are detailed below.



### Integration Management

The coordination between the resources, stakeholders, and other project elements which ensures to execute the project end to end successfully is Project Integration Management. It is very important because project success highly depends on integration management in terms of schedule, cost, quality, scope, risks, etc.

#### 1 – Develop Project Charter 
The ***develop project charter*** process is a document which is prepared in the initiation phase to formally authorize the existence of the project. In this process, the document is prepared and given to the authoritative project manager to use the resources required for the project.

The project charter is a key element which describes the whole project in brief. The project charter generally includes the objective of the project, stakeholders, requirements, high-level assumption and constraints etc.

#### 2 – Develop Project Management Plan 
This is process of combining all the project plans and sub-plans into a single integrated plan. It is one of the most crucial processes of project management. Project success is dependent on the project management plan. The authoritative head to plan project management is the project manager.

This document is approved and signed by authorized stakeholders.

#### 3 – Direct and Manage Project Work 
In this process, the project work activities are directed and managed while executing. This refers to the term “leading and controlling” the assigned project activities. The key outputs of this process are final deliverables and change requests for the project work.

#### 4 – Manage Project Knowledge 
The main objective of this process is to improve the project process using the existing knowledge and creating new knowledge. The knowledge created is used for further processes and future projects. The continuing knowledge gain and utilizing the existing knowledge is the main objective of the project.     

#### 5 – Monitor and Control Project Work 
Monitoring and controlling project work refers to the continuous tracking, reviewing and reporting the project progress status to achieve the required target of the project work activities.

The performances of each assigned resource are monitored and controlled. The document is prepared regarding the issue and the improvement possible.

#### 6 – Perform Integrated Change Control 
The ***perform integrated change control*** process includes reviewing all the change requests and managing them effectively from all the working department. The document is prepared for approval of any change requests.

The change requests are approved when there is not much impact on scope, time and cost of the project. The change requests can be project deliverables, project plan or project assets.

#### 7 – Close Project or Phase 
This process refers to closing the project activities by finalizing all the deliverables of project activities and the documents related to closing the project or phase is prepared by the project manager. In this process, the resources are released to work for other projects.

#### 9 – Collect Requirements 
The process of collecting all the requirements from all the resources or stakeholders to meet the project objective is called Collect Requirement Process. The documentation of all the requirement helps in tracing the matrix of the organizational assets required for the project. The collected requirement is to be managed and fulfilled to meet the objective of the project.

#### 10 – Define Scope 
The complete description of the scope of the project is documented in this process. The main objective of the project is to document what is included in the project and what is not included in the project.

The clear description of the project is available from this process.

#### 11 – Create WBS 
the ***create WBS*** process refers to the Work Breakdown Structure in which all the project activities are divided into smaller activities. This helps in assigning tasks or activities to the resources. This framework also helps in understanding the project objectives and the defined scope. The inputs, tools and techniques, and the outputs are clearly defined in this process.

#### 12 – Validate Scope 
In this process, the final deliverables are validated and accepted by the project manager. It is a formal acceptance of the completed project whether it met the scope or not is validated in this process. Before submitting the final deliverables to the customer, if the project manager validates the scope, then the chances of the customer accepting the projects are also high.

#### 13 – Control Scope 
The ***control scope process*** ensures whether all the project activities are according to the planned scope. This process monitors the status of the project and manages the changes according to the scope baseline. It ensures there is no slippery in the project scope during project activities.
