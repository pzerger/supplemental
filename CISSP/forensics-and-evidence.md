## Types of Evidence

**Original Evidence** - This is evidence collected at the crime scene or incident site. It has not been handled or copied. Examples are original documents, messages, images, etc. Original evidence is considered the most reliable and accurate.

**Secondary Evidence** - This refers to evidence that is derived from original evidence. Examples include digital copies or photographs of original documents. Secondary evidence may be less reliable than originals.

**Circumstantial Evidence** - Evidence that requires additional reasoning or inference to connect it to a conclusion. Circumstantial evidence may imply guilt or innocence.

**Conclusive Evidence** - Evidence that conclusively proves a fact. This type of evidence leads to only one logical conclusion.

**Corroborative Evidence** - Separate evidence that supports or strengthens existing evidence. Corroborative evidence helps validate conclusions.

**Direct Evidence** - Evidence that proves a fact directly without inference or assumption. Eyewitness testimony is direct evidence. 

**Documentary Evidence** - Information recorded in documents rather than orally. This includes paper documents, electronic files, images, videos, etc. Documentary evidence may be original or copies.

**Hearsay Evidence** - Second-hand evidence not directly witnessed. Hearsay relies on the credibility of the source. Courts may exclude hearsay evidence.

**Opinions (Evidence)** - Statements by witnesses based on inferences or judgments, not facts. Opinion evidence has questionable reliability. 

**Possession** - Circumstantial evidence that a person has control or custody of an item. Possession may imply guilt or innocence.

**Real Evidence** - Physical or digital objects presented as evidence in court. Real evidence allows direct examination. 

**Testimonial Evidence** - Oral evidence given by witnesses during legal proceedings. Testimonial evidence relies on witness credibility.

## Evidence Collection, Handling, and Admissibility

**Best Evidence** - The original form of documentary evidence is considered the best evidence. Original documents are more reliable than copies.

**Importance of Collecting Evidence** - Proper collection and preservation of evidence is crucial to ensure accuracy, prevent contamination, and maintain chain of custody. Methodical evidence collection aids the investigation. 

**Chain of Custody** - The chronological documentation showing seizure, custody, control, transfer, and disposition of evidence. Chain of custody demonstrates the integrity of evidence handling.

**Modification** - Digital evidence should never be modified during collection and analysis. Hashing ensures evidence is unaltered.

**Subpoena** - A court order requiring a person to testify as a witness or produce documents and records. Subpoenas aid in collecting admissible evidence.

**Search Warrant** - A court order allowing law enforcement to search premises and seize evidence. Search warrants justify intrusive evidence gathering.

**Voluntary Surrender** - Providing evidence voluntarily without legal compulsion. Voluntarily surrendered evidence avoids rights violations.

**For Evidence to be Admissible** - Evidence must be relevant, authentic, credible, and collected legally following rules of evidence. Courts determine if evidence is admissible.
