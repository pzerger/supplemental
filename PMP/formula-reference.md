### Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR)

**Explanation:** A ratio used to summarize the overall value for money of a project or proposal.

**Situation:** Use when comparing projects or making go/no-go decisions based on the relationship between costs and benefits.

**Formula:**
```
BCR = Present Value of Benefits / Present Value of Costs
```

### Budget at Completion (BAC)

**Formula:** No specific formula; it's determined during project planning.

### Communication Channels

**Explanation:** The number of potential communication channels between project stakeholders.

**Situation:** Use to understand the complexity of communication in a project and plan communication strategies accordingly.

**Formula:**
```
Number of Communication Channels = n * (n - 1) / 2
```
Where n is the number of stakeholders.

### Cost Performance Index (CPI)

**Explanation:** CPI measures the cost efficiency of the project, comparing earned value to actual costs.

**Situation:** Use to determine how efficiently the project is using its budget.

**Formula:**
```
CPI = EV / AC
```

### Cost Plus Award Fee Contract (CPAF)

**Explanation:** A contract type where the seller is reimbursed for costs plus an award fee based on performance.

**Situation:** Use when objective performance measures are difficult to define upfront.

**Formula:** No specific formula; fee structure is defined in the contract.

### Cost Plus Fixed Fee Contract (CPFF)

**Explanation:** A contract type where the seller is reimbursed for costs plus a fixed fee payment.

**Situation:** Use when the scope of work is uncertain but costs need to be controlled.

**Formula:** No specific formula; fee is a fixed amount defined in the contract.

### Cost Plus Incentive Fee Contract (CPIF)

**Explanation:** A contract type where the seller is reimbursed for costs plus an incentive fee based on meeting defined performance targets.

**Situation:** Use when specific performance objectives can be identified and measured.

**Formula:** No specific formula; fee structure is defined in the contract based on performance metrics.

### Cost Plus Percentage of Cost (CPPC)

**Explanation:** A contract type where the seller is reimbursed for costs plus a percentage of costs as profit.

**Situation:** This contract type is generally discouraged due to lack of incentive for cost control.

**Formula:**
```
Total Payment = Actual Costs + (Percentage * Actual Costs)
```

### Cost Variance (CV)

**Explanation:** The difference between the earned value and the actual cost.

**Situation:** Use to determine if the project is over or under budget.

**Formula:**
```
CV = EV - AC
```

### Earned Value (EV)

**Explanation:** The value of work actually completed, expressed in terms of the budget assigned to that work.

**Situation:** Used in various earned value calculations to assess project performance.

**Formula:**
```
EV = % Complete * BAC
```

### Estimate at Completion (EAC)

**Explanation:** The expected total cost of the project at completion.

**Situation:** Use to forecast the final project cost based on current performance.

**Formula:**
```
EAC = AC + (BAC - EV) / CPI
```
(Note: There are multiple formulas for EAC depending on the situation)

### Estimate to Completion (ETC)

**Explanation:** The expected cost to complete all remaining project work.

**Situation:** Use to estimate the remaining budget needed to finish the project.

**Formula:**
```
ETC = EAC - AC
```

### Expected Monetary Value (EMV)

**Explanation:** A technique used to calculate the average outcome of scenarios that may or may not happen.

**Situation:** Use in decision-making processes, particularly for risk analysis and opportunity assessment.

**Formula:**
```
EMV = Probability * Impact
```

### Future Value (FV)

**Explanation:** The value of an asset or cash at a specified date in the future based on an assumed growth rate.

**Situation:** Use in financial planning and investment analysis to project the growth of investments.

**Formula:**
```
FV = PV * (1 + r)^n
```
Where PV is present value, r is interest rate, and n is number of periods.

### Payback Period

**Explanation:** The time required to recover the cost of an investment.

**Situation:** Use when evaluating the attractiveness of an investment or project.

**Formula:**
```
Payback Period = Initial Investment / Annual Cash Inflow
```

### PERT - Beta (Weighted Average)

**Explanation:** PERT Beta is a weighted average calculation used in project management to estimate the expected duration of an activity.

**Situation:** Use this when you have optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely estimates for an activity's duration.

**Formula:**
```
PERT Beta = (Optimistic + 4 * Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 6
```

### PERT Formulas

**Explanation:** PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) formulas are used for estimating project durations and analyzing schedule network diagrams.

**Situation:** Use PERT formulas when dealing with uncertain activity durations in project scheduling.

Formulas: See PERT Beta, PERT Standard Deviation, and PERT Triangular Distribution.

### PERT - Standard Deviation (SD)

**Explanation:** PERT Standard Deviation measures the variability or uncertainty in the PERT estimates.

**Situation:** Use this to determine the range of potential outcomes and assess the risk associated with time estimates.

**Formula:**
```
Standard Deviation = (Pessimistic - Optimistic) / 6
```

### PERT - Triangular Distribution (Mode)

**Explanation:** The Triangular Distribution is a simpler alternative to the PERT Beta, using only three estimates without weighting.

**Situation:** Use when you want a quick, straightforward estimate and don't need the precision of the Beta distribution.

**Formula:**
```
Triangular Distribution = (Optimistic + Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 3
```

### Point of Total Assumption (PTA)

**Explanation:** In a Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF) contract, the point at which the seller assumes all additional costs.

**Situation:** Use in contract negotiations to determine risk sharing between buyer and seller.

**Formula:**
```
PTA = Target Cost + (Ceiling Price - Target Price) / Buyer's Share Ratio
```

### Present Value (PV)

**Explanation:** The current value of a future sum of money, given a specified rate of return.

**Situation:** Use when comparing cash flows at different time periods or evaluating investment opportunities.

**Formula:**
```
PV = FV / (1 + r)^n
```
Where FV is future value, r is interest rate, and n is number of periods.

### Return on Investment (ROI)

**Explanation:** A performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment.

**Situation:** Use when comparing the profitability of different investments or projects.

**Formula:**
```
ROI = (Net Profit / Cost of Investment) * 100
```

### Risk Priority Number (RPN)

**Explanation:** A numeric assessment of risk used in Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA).

**Situation:** Use when prioritizing risks for mitigation in product or process design.

**Formula:**
```
RPN = Severity * Occurrence * Detection
```

### Schedule Performance Index (SPI)

**Explanation:** SPI measures the schedule efficiency of the project, comparing earned value to planned value.

**Situation:** Use to determine if the project is ahead of or behind schedule.

**Formula:**
```
SPI = EV / PV
```

### Schedule Variance (SV)

**Explanation:** The difference between the earned value and the planned value.

**Situation:** Use to determine if the project is ahead of or behind schedule in terms of value.

**Formula:**
```
SV = EV - PV
```

### Target Price

**Explanation:** In incentive contracts, the estimated cost plus target profit that represents the expected final price.

**Situation:** Use in contract negotiations to set expectations and incentives for both buyer and seller.

**Formula:**
```
Target Price = Target Cost + Target Fee
```

### To-Complete Performance Index (TCPI)

**Explanation:** TCPI measures the cost performance that must be achieved to complete the remaining work within a specified budget.

**Situation:** Use when you need to assess the efficiency required to complete the project within budget constraints.

**Formula:**
```
TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC)
```
or
```
TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (EAC - AC)
```

### Variance at Completion (VAC)

**Explanation:** The projected difference between the budget at completion and the estimate at completion.

**Situation:** Use to forecast the amount of budget variance at the end of the project.

**Formula:**
