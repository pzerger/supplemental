# Models (on the PMP and/or CAMP exams)

Broadly speaking, a model is a simplified representation of a complex system or process. It provides a structured framework to understand, analyze, and address project-related challenges. Models are often used to visualize relationships between different elements, predict outcomes, and guide decision-making.

The following is a list of models to aid in project management and delivery that may appear on the PMI Project Management Professional (PMP) and/or Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) exams.

### Intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation model

A model that differentiates between motivation that comes from internal rewards (intrinsic) and external rewards (extrinsic).

**Importance**: This model is crucial for project managers in understanding how to motivate team members effectively, balancing different types of incentives to enhance performance and job satisfaction.

[Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Kotter's change model

An 8-step process for leading change: Create urgency, Form a powerful coalition, Create a vision for change, Communicate the vision, Remove obstacles, Create short-term wins, Build on the change, and Anchor the changes in corporate culture.

**Importance**: This model provides a structured approach to managing organizational change, which is essential for project managers implementing large-scale or transformational projects.
