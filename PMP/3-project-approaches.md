# 3 Project Management Approaches

- [Adaptive](#adaptive)
- [Hybrid](#hybrid)  
- [Predictive (Waterfall)](#predictive-waterfall)

Here are the key differences between agile, hybrid, and predictive project management approaches that may be covered on the PMP exam. The exam is said to be ~50% agile and 50% waterfall. However, recent exam candidates report heavier focus on agile and hybrid.

### Adaptive:

 An iterative approach that breaks down projects into smaller chunks and prioritizes flexibility.

**Characteristics**

- Iterative approach with continuous feedback and adaptation
- Focus on delivering working software increments frequently  
- Flexible scope, embraces change
- Close collaboration with customers
- Self-organizing teams
- Examples: Scrum, Kanban

**When to use:**

- Requirements are rapidly changing or not fully defined upfront
- Shorter timelines, fast results are critical  
- Customer collaboration and continuous feedback is possible
- Smaller or medium sized teams with flexible skills
- Software development or IT projects

### Hybrid: 

A blend of Agile and Predictive methods, combining flexibility with structure.

**Characteristics**

- Combination of predictive and agile approaches  
- Can use agile for software development but predictive for hardware
- Some projects followed predictively, others use agile sprints
- Attempts to get the best of both approaches

**When to use:**

- Elements of predictability are needed but some agility is beneficial
- Organization is transitioning from predictive to agile approaches 
- Some project components suit agile, others predictive methods
- Teams have mixed skills and experience with both methods

### Predictive (Waterfall):

A structured approach with a detailed plan upfront. 

**Characteristics**

- Linear sequential phases
- Scope, budget, timeline locked early
- Detailed upfront planning and documentation
- Change controlled and minimized
- Outputs and approvals at each phase
- Examples: Waterfall, Critical Path Method  

**When to use:**

- Clear requirements that are unlikely to change
- Longer timelines with phased milestones
- Large projects involving many dependencies
- Resource planning and costs need to be closely managed  
- Industries with regulatory compliance needs 
- Hardware or construction projects with fixed deliverables

The main differences are agile emphasizes flexibility, continuous feedback and working software over documentation. Predictive focuses on upfront planning, fixed scope and linear phased progression. Hybrid combines both approaches to get benefits of agile and predictability.

So in summary, agile for rapidly changing needs, predictive for highly stable scope, and hybrid to leverage benefits of both. The project size, industry, team, and product all influence what approach is most suitable.
